<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a Computer System engineer trying to get a developer job, due to my lack of experience I have not beeing able to get it, so I'm making a portfolio with projects of courses that I've been taking.
</p>

<p>I consider myself a dedicated person who loves programming, trying to understand the function of tools 100% to get most out of them, and I also think I'm pretty good at solving problems.</p>

<p>About my hobbies, I love videogames and I like to draw sometimes</p>
